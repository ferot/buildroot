Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images


Basicly it can be translated into :
1) clone repo
2) run :
$ make dms_rpi3_defconfig O=/opt/rpisdk
3) go into /opt/rpisdk (assuming that this dir exists before you trigger that command)
4) run make -j<num_of_cores>
